# TODOseq for Obsidian

Tracks lines starting with 'TODO' as tasks across your vault.

Initial version based on sample plugin
https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/tree/master

Initial main.ts, style.css created using GLM-4.5
> I want to create an Obsidian plugin that will track all lines in the Obsidian Vault that start with the text 'TODO' as todo list tasks, similar to the way task creation is managed in Logseq



Next State Sequence: TODO -> DOING -> DONE
