**TODOseq** allows you to capture tasks using natural language keywords:

TODO Write documentation
DOING Update sync script  
DONE Triage customer feedback

This approach is faster to type and more natural when taking notes or journaling. Click on a task keyword or use the hotkey `Ctrl-Enter` to cycle the state TODO -> DOING -> DONE. Right-click on the keyword to select from the full list of available task states. 

Tasks can be captured with priority and dates for scheduling. Use the Obsidian commands like "Add scheduled date" while on the task line to speed up entry.

DOING [#A] Task with high priority 
TODO [#B] Task with medium and scheduled date
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15>

TODO [#C] Task with low priority, a scheduled date, and a deadline date/time
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15>
DEADLINE: <2026-01-20 17:00>

And if you prefer to use checkboxes jus tprefix the task keyword with the task keyword. Toggleing the checkbox will automatically update the state between TODO and DONE.

- [ ] TODO task with a checkbox
- [x] DONE completed task with a checkbox
