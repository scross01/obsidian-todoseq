TODOseq ("to-do-seek") is a lightweight, keyword-based task tracker for Obsidian. It scans your vault for task lines that begin with simple state keywords (e.g., TODO, DOING, DONE) and presents them in a dedicated Task View. Inspired by [Logseq Tasks](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/tasks), TODOseq preserves your original Markdown formatting and does not require checkbox syntax.

TODO This is a regular task
DOING This is an active tasks
DONE This is a completed task #work

TODO This is a scheduled task #work
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-31>

TODO [#A] This is a high priority task
LATER This is a different state keyword

CANCELLED This is a cancelled task
